# Butter — Roadmap & Changelog

The single source of truth for what's been built, what's next, and the version
behind each release. Pass G of Phase 4 will add an in-app **"What's New"** popup;
the **Changelog** sections below are written to feed it (user-facing wording +
`✨ New` / `🐛 Fix` / `🔧 Change` tags).

---

## Versioning

`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (SemVer) + a build number:

| Part | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **MAJOR** | Product generation | `1` (→ `2` on a big rewrite) |
| **MINOR** | Phase | Phase 4 → `4` |
| **PATCH** | Pass within the phase | Pass E (5th) → `5` |
| **build** | Part of a pass | E4 → build `4` |

Source of truth: `butter/app.json` (`version` + `ios.buildNumber` / `android.versionCode`),
shown in **Settings → version footer** (`src/lib/version.ts`).

**Current:** `v1.4.5` — Phase 4, Pass E (in progress).

# Changelog (shipped)

## Phase 1 — MVP expense tracker · `v1.1`
Core <5-second expense logging.

- ✨ Home: today total + recent list. **Insights:** month strip + category donut chart + legend. **History:** all expenses grouped by month. **Category drill-down** screen.
- ✨ SQLite (native) data layer; game-state scaffold (streak/coins/entries).

## Phase 2 — Mascot, theme & animation · `v1.2`
Butter comes to life.
- ✨ Butter v2 — layered/jointed SVG mascot (grounded feet, paw pads), **hybrid animation** (body via transforms, arms via drawn pose frames).
- ✨ Moods derived from activity (sleepy / happy / excited); idle flourishes (drowsy tip, hops, wave-giggle, turn-around); tiered celebrations (coin-fly, confetti, milestone jump) + speech bubbles.
- ✨ Warm "butter" theme, Baloo 2 + Nunito fonts, first-run coachmark.

## Phase 3 — Data portability · `v1.3`
Your data, yours to keep.

- 🔧 Web build (react-native-web + localStorage) deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Phase 4 — Gamification · `v1.4` *(in progress)*
Dress up Butter, earn coins, build streaks.

### Pass A — Outfit engine + art · `v1.4.1`
- ✨ Outfit overlay rendering (head / face / neck / body / held) composited on Butter, front & back.

- ✨ **Shop** tab landing (coin balance + Wardrobe / Consumables / Invest cards); 🧥 hanger on Home → Wardrobe.

### Pass C — Changing room · `v1.4.3`
- ✨ Three-state Changing Room: play · room (panel closed) · dress-up (item panel).
- ✨ Try-before-buy (preview unowned items); Save Look persists the outfit.
- 🔧 **Revisions:** half-body baker apron (upper fur shows); held items follow the paw on a wave; tap-anywhere opens/closes the item panel (no more Wardrobe button); bigger Butter; "Turn" rotate; red "Reset"; **Save only items you own**; "Fitting Room" / "Leave" labels.

### Pass D — Play gestures · `v1.4.4`
- ✨ In the play room: **tap Butter** to react (mood-appropriate gesture), **hold to pet** (cosy rock + happy face).

### Pass E — Streak economy + popups · `v1.4.5` *(in progress)*
- ✨ **E1 — Coin multiplier economy:** streak multiplier ×1.0 → ×3.0 (at 3/7/14/30/100 days); daily coin **cap scales** with it (60 → 180); one-time **milestone chests**; new players get a **50-coin welcome grant**.
- ✨ **E2 — Shop overhaul:** re-priced 4-tier ladder (50 → 2,200); **rarity** tiles & badges — Basic (white) · Rare (blue) · Premium (purple) · Prestige (gold); item pictures on the cards; long names gently scroll (marquee).
- ✨ **Sell:** sell owned items for 50% back; **buy/sell confirmation** popup with the item picture + rarity.
- ✨ **E3 — Streak popup:** tap the 🔥 chip to see your streak, multiplier, the full tier ladder + chests, and a "streak safe" nudge; 🪙 chip opens the Shop.
- ✨ **E4 — Developer mode:** tap the version 7× to unlock a sandboxed dev panel (edit coins/streak/wardrobe, triggers, inspector); changes are discarded on exit. App versioning (v1.4.5).
- 🐛 **Fixes:** mascot no longer gets stuck on the celebrating face after a mood change; dev coins quick-add accumulates; Back works after a web refresh on any pushed screen; long-press to pet no longer selects text.
- ⬜ **E5 — Daily-cap popup** *(next):* a friendly "daily coins maxed" message when a log hits the scaled cap.

# Roadmap (upcoming)

## Phase 4 — remaining
- **E5 — DailyCapSheet** — popup on crossing the daily coin cap (off the existing `capReached` signal). *Last stage of Pass E.*
- **Pass F — Story panels** — narrative/onboarding panels (was the original Pass E, pushed back).
- **Pass G — Polish** — playroom & changing-room **backgrounds**, transitions, sfx, **and the "What's New" update popup driven by this changelog**.

## Phase 5 — Charts & ship polish · `v1.5`
- Deeper insights/charts, app icon + splash, empty-state & perf polish, store-ready pass.

## Phase 6 — Consumables & Invest · `v1.6`
- **6a Consumables** — streak-freeze, double-coin day (cap-bypass / streak-protection coin sinks).
- **6b Invest** — put coins to work (coins-as-faucet endgame; keeps the ×3 economy meaningful).

## Phase 7 — Collections · `v1.7`
- **Set items & set effects** — group items into themed sets; full sets grant a bonus (economy boost and/or a cosmetic mascot flourish). 7a data model → 7b effect engine → 7c set UI.

## Phase 8 — Live content · `v1.8`
- **Seasonal items** — limited-time drops with a **green "✦ Seasonal"** tag (a tag layered on top of rarity, *not* a 5th rarity tier — premium took purple, so green is free for seasonal); rotating/featured shop; first seasonal set.
